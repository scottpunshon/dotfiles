# Readline configuration
#
# These configuration commands can only go in either /etc/inputrc or ~/.inputrc (i.e. calling from a Bash prompt won't work)
# To change these values from a prompt (e.g. to put them in ~/.bashrc),
# the entire command needs to be passed as the first arg to the `bind` command.
# NOTE: values set using `bind` take precendence over these settings in ~/.inputrc
# e.g.
#	bind "set completion-ignore-case on"

# Case insensitive Tab completion (for file names etc)
set completion-ignore-case on

# This causes symlink-ed directories to complete as 'dir/'
set mark-symlinked-directories on

# Terminal bell: none, visible or audible
set bell-style none


# Stop delete word (Ctrl-W) on directory delimiter
# Default 'unix-word-rubout' deletes up to next whitespace.
# Instead 'unix-filename-rubout' deletes up to next filename boundary (i.e. slash or whitespace)
# NOTE: need to set bind-tty-special-chars off in order to be allowed to remap Ctrl-W
set bind-tty-special-chars off
"\C-w": unix-filename-rubout
